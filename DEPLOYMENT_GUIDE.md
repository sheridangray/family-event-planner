# ChatGPT Event Discovery - Production Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### ✅ 1. Code Deployment (COMPLETED)
- [x] Code committed and pushed to main branch
- [x] Render.com will automatically deploy the changes

### ⏳ 2. Environment Configuration (NEXT STEP)

**Add API Key to Production Environment:**

1. Go to [Render.com Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Navigate to your backend service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add new environment variable:
   ```
   CHATGPT_API_KEY=chatgpt_d34a5deb43e66c59b1a94997a641f8ec3eb2f7c6cdc6fb619d462c21961f4475
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes**
6. The service will automatically redeploy

### ⏳ 3. Database Migration (AUTOMATIC)

The database migration will happen automatically when the backend restarts because:
- The table creation is in `src/database/postgres.js`
- It runs on every startup
- The migration is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

### ⏳ 4. Verify Deployment

Run the production test script:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
node scripts/test-production-api.js
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Testing Production ChatGPT Event Discovery API...

📡 Testing GET endpoint...
✅ GET endpoint working
   Found 0 existing discoveries

📡 Testing POST endpoint...
✅ POST endpoint working
   Discovery ID: 1
   Events saved: 1

🎉 Production API test complete!
```

### ⏳ 5. Update ChatGPT Scheduled Action

1. Go to your ChatGPT scheduled action settings
2. Replace the entire prompt with the content from `docs/CHATGPT_PROMPT_CONFIGURATION.md`
3. Ensure the schedule is set to daily at 9:00 AM
4. Save and enable the action

### ⏳ 6. Test End-to-End

1. **Wait for scheduled run** or trigger manually
2. **Check backend logs** on Render.com for incoming requests
3. **Visit your frontend** at `/dashboard/chatgpt-suggestions`
4. **Verify discoveries appear** in the UI
