## Mocking Strategy

### External Services
All external services are mocked by default to ensure:
- Fast, reliable test execution
- No external dependencies during testing
- Controlled error scenarios
- Consistent test results

**Mocked Services:**
- Twilio SMS API
- Google Calendar API
- Gmail API
- Puppeteer browser automation
- Database connections

### Mock Configurations
```javascript
// In test files, configure mocks as needed:
const mockServices = createMockGoogleServices();
mockServices._mockCalendar.setFailureMode('auth');
mockServices._mockGmail.setCalendarEvents('joyce@example.com', [conflictEvent]);
```

## 📅 **Testing Schedule**

### **Daily Development**
```bash
# After every feature/bug fix
npm run test:quick

# Before every commit (MANDATORY)
npm run test:security:critical
```

# Wednesday: Performance validation
npm run test:performance

# Friday: Comprehensive testing
npm run test:weekly
```

## Coverage Requirements

The project maintains enhanced coverage thresholds:

### **Critical Systems (MUST BE 100%)**
- **Payment Guard**: 100% coverage (MANDATORY)
- **Security Systems**: 100% coverage (MANDATORY)
- **Authentication**: 95%+ coverage

### **General Coverage Targets**
- **Branches**: 75% (increased from 70%)
- **Functions**: 80% (increased from 70%)
- **Lines**: 80% (increased from 70%)
- **Statements**: 80% (increased from 70%)

### **Critical Business Logic**
- Core automation workflows: 95%+ coverage
- Payment processing prevention: 100% coverage
- Data protection and privacy: 95%+ coverage

## 🚨 **Critical Test Requirements**

### **NEVER DEPLOY WITHOUT**
1. ✅ `npm run test:security:critical` - **MUST PASS** (Payment guard protection)
2. ✅ `npm run test:pre-deploy` - **MUST PASS** (System validation)

### **Payment Guard Tests - CRITICAL**
```bash
# These must ALWAYS pass before any deployment
npm run test:security:critical
```
**Why Critical:** Prevents automated payments for paid events - system-wide financial protection

## Best Practices

### **Security-First Testing**
1. **Always run critical security tests first**
2. **Never skip payment guard validation**
3. **Test security before functionality**
4. **Validate all external service payment prevention**

### Writing Tests
1. **Use descriptive test names** that explain the scenario
2. **Test both happy path and error conditions**
3. **Mock external dependencies** appropriately
4. **Use beforeEach/afterEach** for proper test isolation
5. **Test edge cases** and boundary conditions
6. **Include security validation in all tests**

### Debugging Tests
```bash
# Run with debugging enabled
DEBUG=* npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- payment-guard.test.js

# Critical security debugging
npm run test:security:critical -- --verbose

# Run with increased timeout for debugging
npm test -- --testTimeout=60000

# Load test debugging
npm run test:load -- --verbose
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Optimized for CI environments
npm run test:ci
```
This command:
- Runs all tests once (no watch mode)
- Generates coverage reports
- Uses appropriate timeouts for CI

### **Production CI/CD Pipeline**
```yaml
# Required CI/CD steps
1. npm run test:security:critical  # BLOCKING - must pass
2. npm run test:quick             # Fast validation
3. npm run test:pre-deploy        # BLOCKING - must pass
4. npm run test:performance       # Performance validation
```

## Manual Testing Scripts

For scenarios requiring real external service testing:

### SMS Testing
```bash
npm run test:sms
```
- Tests actual SMS parsing logic
- Displays comprehensive parsing results
- Useful for validating new response patterns

### Calendar Integration Testing  
```bash
npm run test:calendar
```
- Tests real Google Calendar API integration
- Validates authentication and permissions
- Helps debug calendar access issues

## Common Testing Scenarios

### Testing New SMS Response Patterns
1. Add test cases to `test/unit/sms-parsing.test.js`
2. Run `npm run test:sms` to validate manually
3. Ensure coverage includes both unit and integration tests

### Testing Error Handling
1. Use `FailingMockDatabase` for database error simulation
2. Configure service mocks with appropriate failure modes
3. Verify graceful degradation and proper logging

### Testing Real External Services
1. Use manual test scripts for initial validation
2. Create integration tests with controlled mock data
3. Document any external service requirements in test comments

## Continuous Improvement

### Adding New Tests
When adding new features:
1. **Start with unit tests** for core logic
2. **Add integration tests** for workflows
3. **Include error scenarios** for resilience
4. **Update manual tests** if external services are involved

### Monitoring Test Health
- Review coverage reports regularly
- Investigate flaky tests immediately
- Update mocks when external APIs change
- Maintain test performance (target < 30s for full suite)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Test timeouts**: Increase timeout or check for infinite loops
2. **Mock not working**: Verify mock setup in `test/setup.js`
3. **Coverage too low**: Add tests for untested code paths
4. **Flaky tests**: Check for race conditions or external dependencies

### Getting Help
- Check existing test files for patterns
- Review mock implementations in `test/mocks/`
- Use `DEBUG=*` for verbose logging during tests
- Run manual test scripts to isolate issues
