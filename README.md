## 🚨 **Emergency Procedures**

### Payment Safety Violations
```
1. 🚨 System automatically halts all automation
2. 📸 Screenshots captured of the issue  
3. 📝 Detailed logs written to error tracking
4. 🔔 Alert sent to error monitoring system
5. 🛠️ Manual intervention required to resume
```

### System Health Issues
```
Critical Errors    → Automatic service restart + alerts
High Error Rates   → Degraded mode operation  
Database Issues    → Emergency backup + read-only mode
External API Fails → Graceful fallback to manual processes
```

## 🔒 **Security & Privacy**

### Data Protection
- **No Payment Data**: Zero credit card or banking information stored
- **Encrypted Credentials**: All API keys and tokens securely encrypted
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: End-to-end encryption for all communications
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Only necessary family and preference data
- **Regular Backups**: Automated database backups with encryption

### Access Control
- **Family-Only Access**: Restricted to authorized family members
- **OAuth Authentication**: Google-based secure login system
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT tokens with expiration
- **API Key Protection**: Rate limiting and request validation
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged for security review

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**📧 Emails Not Sending**
```bash
# Check OAuth token status
GET /health

# Verify Gmail API credentials
# Review logs: logs/combined.log
```

**🔍 Scraping Failures**
```bash
# Test individual scrapers
POST /api/automation/scrape {"source": "Exploratorium"}

# Check scraper health
GET /api/automation/health
```

**🤖 Registration Failures**
```bash
# Review automation logs
GET /api/automation/status

# Check screenshots: logs/screenshots/
# Review error details in logs/errors.json
```

**📅 Calendar Issues**
```bash
# Test OAuth token refresh
# Verify Google Calendar API access
# Check calendar sharing permissions
```
