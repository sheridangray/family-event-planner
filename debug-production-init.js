// Debug what's happening with production initialization

console.log('üîç Debugging production initialization issues...\n');

console.log('Looking at the production logs, I can see:');
console.log('1. ‚úÖ SMS Manager not available (expected)');
console.log('2. ‚úÖ "Email-only notification service initialized as SMS fallback" - MISSING!');
console.log('3. ‚ùå "Error checking approval timeouts" - This suggests unifiedNotifications is null');

console.log('üêõ THE PROBLEM:');
console.log('Production logs show the server starts but we never see:');
console.log('   "Email-only notification service initialized as SMS fallback"');
console.log('');
console.log('This means the UnifiedNotificationService initialization is failing in production,');

console.log('üîß SOLUTION NEEDED:');
